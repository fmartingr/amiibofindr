## Contributing

For running the local environment, you will need [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

The `vagrant up` command will fire up a local virtual machine and install all requirements.

You can access the inside of the **VM** using `vagrant ssh` to run the default django manage commands.
